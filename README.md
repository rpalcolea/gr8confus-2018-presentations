### High performant in-memory datasets with Netflix H0110W

Are you encountering problems which require dissemination of small-mid size datasets? Do you need to distribute this data across multiple regions on different clouds or on premises? Probably you are sending this data to a NoSQL data store and querying it in runtime or distributing JSON/XML files across all your servers to accomplish this. Netflix Hollow is a java library and toolset for disseminating in-memory datasets from a single producer to many consumers for high performance read-only access. In this talk I will show how Hollow can help you to distribute datasets on different environments using blob storages for KB, MB or few GB of data, optimizing the performance of your applications and achieving extreme stability and reliability by showcasing different aspects of Hollow and potential use cases for it in your projects including examples with APIs written in ratpack

###  High Scalable Streaming Microservices with Kafka Streams

Apache Kafka offers a highly scalable, mission critical infrastructure for distributed messaging and integration.

Kafka Streams is a library for building streaming applications, specifically applications that transform input Kafka topics into output Kafka topics (or calls to external services, or updates to databases, or exposing the data via HTTP). Kafka Streams API allows to embed stream processing into any application or microservice to add lightweight but scalable and mission-critical stream processing logic.

In this talk, I will show how you can build streaming micro services that are high scalable and easy to deploy using Kafka streams and groovy
